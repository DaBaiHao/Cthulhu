Based on the code below in file [SpinMe.cs](https://github.com/DaBaiHao/Cthulhu/blob/master/Cthulhu/Assets/Utility/SpinMe.cs) :

``` C
float xDegreesPerFrame = Time.deltaTime / 60 * 360 * xRotationsPerMinute;
transform.RotateAround(transform.position, transform.right, xDegreesPerFrame);
float yDegreesPerFrame = Time.deltaTime / 60 * 360 * yRotationsPerMinute;
transform.RotateAround(transform.position, transform.up, yDegreesPerFrame);
float zDegreesPerFrame = Time.deltaTime / 60 * 360 * zRotationsPerMinute;
transform.RotateAround(transform.position, transform.forward, zDegreesPerFrame);
```
